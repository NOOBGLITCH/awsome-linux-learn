# Welcome to the **Learn Linux** Repository! 🐧

This project provides you with essential information, cheat sheets, and commands to master Linux. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, this repository is your go-to guide for navigating the Linux operating system. 

## 🔧 **Prerequisites**

To get the most out of this repository, you need:
- A basic understanding of how to use the Linux terminal.
- A Linux operating system (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.) or a virtual environment like Docker to practice.

For beginners, it's recommended to start with the **Cheat Sheets** and **Commands** sections before diving into loops, functions, and scripts.

## 📚 **What You Will Find**

- **Cheat Sheets**: Quick reference guides for common Linux commands, utilities, and configurations.
- **Commands**: A comprehensive list of essential commands categorized by functionality.
- **Loops & Functions**: Detailed explanations and examples of loops (`for`, `while`, `until`) and functions in shell scripting to automate tasks and improve productivity.

## **1. Understanding File Permissions in Linux 🔒**

File permissions determine who can **read**, **write**, or **execute** a file. These permissions are divided into three categories:
- **Owner**: `rwx` (full access).
- **Group**: `r-x` (read and execute only).
- **Others**: `r--` (read only).

This helps in managing file access and security for different users on a system.

---

## **2. Using `chmod` to Modify Permissions ⚙️**

The `chmod` command is used to modify file and directory permissions.

### **Command Syntax**
```bash
chmod [options] mode file
```
- `mode`: Defines the new permissions (numeric or symbolic).
- `file`: The target file or directory.

### **Common Examples**
1. **Set full access (777)**:
   ```bash
   chmod 777 file.txt
   ```

2. **Set read/write for owner, read for group and others (644)**:
   ```bash
   chmod 644 file.txt
   ```

3. **Recursive permissions for directories**:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 /path/to/directory
   ```

## **3. Conditional Operators in Linux 🧮**

Conditional operators are used to perform comparisons or checks in shell scripts.

### **Numeric Operators**
- **`-eq`**: Equal to.
- **`-ne`**: Not equal to.
- **`-lt`**: Less than.
- **`-le`**: Less than or equal to.
- **`-gt`**: Greater than.
- **`-ge`**: Greater than or equal to.

### **String Operators**
- **`=`**: Strings are equal.
- **`!=`**: Strings are not equal.
- **`-z`**: String is null (zero length).
- **`-n`**: String is not null.

### **File/Directory Tests**
- **`-f`**: File exists and is a regular file.
- **`-d`**: Directory exists.
- **`-e`**: File or directory exists.
- **`-r`**: File is readable.
- **`-w`**: File is writable.
- **`-x`**: File is executable.

## **4. Linux Loops 🔄**

Loops automate repetitive tasks in Linux by executing commands based on conditions.

### **For Loop**  
Iterates over a fixed range or list.

**Syntax**:
```bash
for variable in list; do
  commands
done
```

**Examples**:
1. **Using a range with `{}`**:
   ```bash
   for i in {1..10}; do
     echo $i
   done
   ```

2. **Using C-style syntax (`i++`)**:
   ```bash
   for ((i = 1; i < 10; i++)); do
     echo $i
   done
   ```

---

### **While Loop**  
Executes commands as long as a condition is true.

**Syntax**:
```bash
while [ condition ]; do
  commands
done
```

**Example**:
```bash
i=1
while [ $i -le 10 ]; do
  echo $i
  i=$((i + 1))
done
```

---

### **Until Loop**  
Executes commands until a condition becomes true.

**Syntax**:
```bash
until [ condition ]; do
  commands
done
```

**Example**:
```bash
i=1
until [ $i -gt 10 ]; do
  echo $i
  i=$((i + 1))
done
```

---

### **Do-While Loop (Simulated)**  
Linux does not have a direct `do-while` loop, but you can simulate it using a `while` loop.

**Purpose**: Executes commands at least once before checking the condition.

**Syntax**:
```bash
commands
while [ condition ]; do
  commands
done
```

**Example**:
```bash
i=1
echo $i
while [ $i -lt 10 ]; do
  i=$((i + 1))
  echo $i
done
```
