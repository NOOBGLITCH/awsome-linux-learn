## **1. Understanding File Permissions in Linux**
Linux permissions define how users interact with files and directories. Each file or directory has three permission sets:
- **Owner**: The creator of the file.
- **Group**: Users within the assigned group.
- **Others**: All other users.

### **Key Permission Types**
- **Read (r)**: Allows viewing file contents.
- **Write (w)**: Allows editing the file.
- **Execute (x)**: Allows running a file as a program or accessing a directory.

### **Numeric Representation**
Each permission is represented by a number:
- **`rwx`** = 7 (4 + 2 + 1)
- **`rw-`** = 6 (4 + 2)
- **`r--`** = 4

### **Example**
Permissions displayed as:
```bash
-rwxr-xr--

Breakdown:

Owner: rwx (full access).
Group: r-x (read and execute only).
Others: r-- (read only).
```
## **2. Using `chmod` to Modify Permissions**
### **Command Syntax**
```bash
chmod [options] mode file


### **Common Examples**
- Set full access (777):
```bash
chmod 777 file.txt
```
- Set read/write for owner, read for group and others (644):
```bash
chmod 644 file.txt
```
- Recursive permissions for directories:
```bash
chmod -R 755 /path/to/directory
```

## **3. Conditional Operators in Linux**
### **Numeric Operators**
- -eq: Equal to.
- -ne: Not equal to.
- -lt: Less than.
- -le: Less than or equal to.
- -gt: Greater than.
- -ge: Greater than or equal to.

### **String Operators**
- =: Strings are equal.
- !=: Strings are not equal.
- -z: String is null (zero length).
- -n: String is not null.

### **File/Directory Tests**
- -f: File exists and is a regular file.
- -d: Directory exists.
- -e: File or directory exists.
- -r: File is readable.
- -w: File is writable.
- -x: File is executable.

## **4. Linux Loops**
Loops automate repetitive tasks by executing commands multiple times based on conditions.

### **For Loop**
```bash
for variable in list; do
  commands
done
```

### **While Loop**
```bash
while [ condition ]; do
  commands
done
```

### **Until Loop**
```bash
until [ condition ]; do
  commands
done
```

### **Do-While Loop (Simulated)**
Linux shell scripting does not have a direct do-while loop, but it can be simulated using while.

```bash
commands
while [ condition ]; do
  commands
done
```
